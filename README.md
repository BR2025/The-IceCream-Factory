# The IceCream Factory
Welcome to The IceCream Factory project! Our aim is to create a hosted HTTPS website for an Ice Cream shop called The IceCream Factory, showcasing their menu, contact information, and the range of services available at their store.

Additionally, we're implementing a feature where registered customers will receive email notifications about discounts, new flavors, or any upcoming events organized by the shop.
